► General-Purpose Sites / Search Engines

    General-purpose torrent sites. Torrent search engines/aggregators/DHT crawlers are listed to search within as many publicly listed torrents as possible to find rare content that cannot be found in any of the trackers listed in the above categories.

    When using torrent search engines/DHT crawlers, they will list as many publicly available torrents as possible, unfiltered and unfettered in regards to viruses. Never use thse to search for software, but when searching for other media types, take some preliminary measures to avoid running malware.

 

 

Notes on software and sites to avoid:

    Try to avoid the pirate bay if you can (for software/games), it is filled to the brim with malware torrents. Skulled users are not trustworthy either.
        You can still use The Pirate Bay safely when searching for other media types (video, audio, etc.) if you follow some basic steps.

    uTorrent has bundled malware (a bitcoin miner) into the software in the past. The company developing this software is not trustworthy. Bittorrent (the torrent client) is owned by the same company.

    Bitlord (torrent client) is malware.

    Soda Stream is malware.

    Sidify/Allavsoft are scams - They are not able to download from spotify in any way, and instead record the streams or download from alternative platforms, like youtube.

    Peerblock is garbage and placebo software. Peerblock's blocklists are not accurate in any way and is not able to discern between the IP of a normal user and that of a copyright troll.
